# Sponsor My Journey: From Ultra-Marathons to Open Source

### Ciao! I'm Pierluigi De Rogatis. üëã

Greetings from Caserta, Italy. By day, I'm a business developer and software enthusiast, but my true laboratory is the rugged trails and mountains of ultra-marathons.

For me, running 100 miles and writing 10,000 lines of code are not that different. Both demand **discipline, resilience, and a data-driven obsession with performance**. The same mental fortitude that gets me through a grueling race at 3 AM is what fuels me during a long night of debugging.

I've learned that pushing physical and mental limits unlocks a new level of potential. Now, my mission is to codify those lessons into technology.

## The Mission: The WatchForward Ecosystem üöÄ

This journey is converging into a single, ambitious open-source project: the **WatchForward ecosystem**.

It's a suite of web applications, powered by AI, designed to be your intelligent partner in performance and lifestyle. Think of it as a system that learns about you to provide insights on:

* **Fitness & Training:** Optimizing your workouts and recovery.
* **Productivity:** Understanding your focus patterns and energy levels.
* **Lifestyle:** Building sustainable habits for long-term health.

I'm building the tools I wish I had when I started: tools that are open, accessible, and built on the philosophy that technology should empower us.

## Why Your Sponsorship Matters üôè

Open source is a labor of love, but it has real-world costs. Your sponsorship is not a donation; it's an investment in a shared vision. It directly helps me cover:

* **üíª Infrastructure Costs:** Servers, databases, and hosting for the WatchForward platform.
* **ü§ñ API & Service Fees:** Costs for AI models, mapping services, and other essential APIs.
* **üï∞Ô∏è My Most Valuable Asset: Time.** Your support allows me to dedicate focused hours away from client work to design, code, and maintain this ecosystem. It's the fuel that turns ideas into features.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Support the Mission

This project is a labor of love, built on the belief that we can use technology to unlock our potential. If you find value in my work, please consider supporting the journey.
