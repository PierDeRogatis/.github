# Sponsor My Journey: From Ultra-Marathons to Open Source

### Ciao! I'm Pierluigi De Rogatis. 👋

Greetings from Caserta, Italy. By day, I'm a software engineer and architect, but my true laboratory is the rugged trails and mountains of ultra-marathons.

For me, running 100 miles and writing 10,000 lines of code are not that different. Both demand **discipline, resilience, and a data-driven obsession with performance**. The same mental fortitude that gets me through a grueling race at 3 AM is what fuels me during a long night of debugging.

I've learned that pushing physical and mental limits unlocks a new level of potential. Now, my mission is to codify those lessons into technology.

## The Mission: The WatchForward Ecosystem 🚀

This journey is converging into a single, ambitious open-source project: the **WatchForward ecosystem**.

It's a suite of web applications, powered by AI, designed to be your intelligent partner in performance and lifestyle. Think of it as a system that learns about you to provide insights on:

* **Fitness & Training:** Optimizing your workouts and recovery.
* **Productivity:** Understanding your focus patterns and energy levels.
* **Lifestyle:** Building sustainable habits for long-term health.

I'm building the tools I wish I had when I started—tools that are open, accessible, and built on the philosophy that technology should empower us.

## Why Your Sponsorship Matters 🙏

Open source is a labor of love, but it has real-world costs. Your sponsorship is not a donation; it's an investment in a shared vision. It directly helps me cover:

* **💻 Infrastructure Costs:** Servers, databases, and hosting for the WatchForward platform.
* **🤖 API & Service Fees:** Costs for AI models, mapping services, and other essential APIs.
* **🕰️ My Most Valuable Asset: Time.** Your support allows me to dedicate focused hours away from client work to design, code, and maintain this ecosystem. It's the fuel that turns ideas into features.

Every contribution, no matter the size, accelerates this mission and helps keep the entire ecosystem free and open for everyone.

*Thank you for considering sponsoring my work. Let's build something extraordinary together.*
